PROJECT TITLE:Group Project 3
PURPOSE OF PROJECT:Indexing
VERSION or DATE:12/4/20
HOW TO START THIS PROJECT:FullControllerClass
AUTHORS:Kyle C, Andrew H, Christian H
USER INSTRUCTIONS:
Our goal of this project was to create an index, like you would see in the back of a textbook, for a given text file. Where the index mapped out every word to occur and at what line numbers throughout the text, since our data lacked page numbers. To accomplish this we utilized three different data structures: ArrayList, TreeMap, and HashMap. With the purpose of comparing their performance of handling such a large data set, in order to be able to determine each data structure's strengths and weaknesses. Run the FullControllerClass for timing on each data structure.
